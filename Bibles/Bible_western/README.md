When we were finding Bible versions, we manually or automatically scraped Bibles from different sources. The best version was [hyw.bibleOTNT.hycatholic.txt](hyw.bibleOTNT.hycatholic/hyw.bibleOTNT.hycatholic.txt) and this is the version   that that we report on. 

* The [hyw.bibleOTNT.asdvadzashunch](hyw.bibleOTNT.asdvadzashunch/hyw.bibleOTNT.asdvadzashunch.txt) file was from a [blog](https://asdvadzashunch.blogspot.com/). But it had too typos and punctuation issues.

* The [hyw.bibleOTNT.JW](hyw.bibleOTNT.JW/hyw.bibleOTNT.JW.txt) was from the [Jehova's Witnesses website](https://www.jw.org/hyw/գրադարան/աստուածաշունչ/արեւմտահայերէն-աստուածաշունչ-1981/գիրքեր//)  but it was getting too hard to scrape completely.

* The [hyw.bibleNT.sacredtext](hyw.bibleNT.sacredtext/hyw.bibleNT.sacredtext.txt) file was [Sacred-Texts](https://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/wb/armw/) but it only had the New Testament.

* The [hyw.bibleOTNT.hycatholic](hyw.bibleOTNT.hycatholic/hyw.bibleOTNT.hycatholic.txt) is from [HYCATHOLIC](https://hycatholic.ru/biblia/) and it was manually scraped. An accompanying [PDF](https://hycatholic.ru/biblio/bible-wa/biblia-wa.pdf) version states that this edition was made in 1994 as a re-print of some undescribed earlier version (like the 1853 version) with corrections.
