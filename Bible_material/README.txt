When we were finding Bible versions, we manually or automatically scraped Bibles from different sources. The best version was the from the Armenian Catholic website. Its version is that that we report on. 

* The Blog_bible was from a blog https://asdvadzashunch.blogspot.com/ But it had too typos and punctuation issues

* The Jehova's witness bible was from the JW website  but it was getting too hard to scrape completely https://www.jw.org/hyw/գրադարան/աստուածաշունչ/արեւմտահայերէն-աստուածաշունչ-1981/գիրքեր/

* The SacredText bible was https://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/wb/armw/ but it only had the New Testament

* The Catholic bible is from https://hycatholic.ru/biblia/ and it was manually scraped
