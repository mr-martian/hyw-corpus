When we were finding Bible versions, we manually or automatically scraped Bibles from different sources. The best version was hyw.bibleOTNT.hycatholic and this is the version   that that we report on. 

* The hyw.bibleOTNT.asdvadzashunch was from a blog https://asdvadzashunch.blogspot.com/ But it had too typos and punctuation issues

* The hyw.bibleOTNT.JW was from the Jehova's Witnesses website  but it was getting too hard to scrape completely https://www.jw.org/hyw/գրադարան/աստուածաշունչ/արեւմտահայերէն-աստուածաշունչ-1981/գիրքեր/

* The hyw.bibleNT.sacredtext bible was https://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/wb/armw/ but it only had the New Testament

* The hyw.bibleOTNT.hycatholic is from https://hycatholic.ru/biblia/ and it was manually scraped
